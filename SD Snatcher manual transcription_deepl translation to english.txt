The Five Articles of JUNKER

(1)
The purpose of JUNKER is to process the bioroid: the snatcher.
(2)
A JUNKER must not hurt anyone, even if it is to do (1).
(3)
JUNKER cannot be physically searched or detained unless there is full evidence of his snatcher status. (Article 18.12 of the Civil Code, Human Rights Protection on Snatcher Issues)
(4)
JUNKER has a duty to cooperate with and support the public bounty hunters (Section 3 of the Criminal Law Special Provisions, Assistance to Bounty Hunters).
(5)
A JUNKER is allowed to possess special powers, blasters, navigators, and tricycles to perform (1).

Åú
JUNKERs are required to perform their duties in accordance with the above regulations and may be deprived of their "JUNKER rights" if they violate the regulations.

Bounty Hunter System.

At the end of 2041, the Metropolitan Police Department enlisted the help of citizens regarding snatchers and established the following bounty system
A "bounty hunter" system was enacted for all citizens of Kouvet who have the right to vote, allowing them to register as bounty hunters through a simple procedure (proof of firearm ownership, psychological test, JUNKER test....etc.). Remuneration after snatcher processing will be considered according to the situation.
For registered hunters, a large amount of insurance coverage is added to the accuracy of the claims for accidents in the course of duty.

Åú
navigator

(NAVI METAL GEAR mkII putit = petit metal)

The navigator is a shoulder-mounted type navigator that has been miniaturized to the limit to concentrate functions so as not to interfere with the runner's activities.
It analyzes the enemy and investigative information. Connected to the headquarters, the status of the investigation is transmitted in real time.
In addition, it can control the runner's deltoid muscle, upper arm, and biceps, and even if the runner is unconscious, it can attack the enemy. For this reason, it needs to be placed on the runner's critical arm side.

SNATCHER
-The Snatcher.

What is a snatcher?

A mysterious bioroid.
It appears every winter since First Contact in 2039, killing people, secretly replacing them with its own, and infiltrating society. It is clothed in artificial skin and can sweat and bleed. It is extremely organic and inorganic. They are almost indistinguishable from the original. They are called "snatchers" from the fact that they switch with the human body (snatch).

Snatcher's Creatures.

Snatchers have created a wide variety of useable robots as a means of direct attack on Neo-Covecity. These are called "Metal Creatures".
There are currently more than 40 of them, with variations such as offensive, defensive, and fast-moving types. They vary in intelligence, ranging from those that can only use guns such as needle guns to more sophisticated ones that can throw paralyzing bullets and nets, depending on the opponent.

NEO-KOBE-CITY
-Neo-Cove City.

Neo-Cove City.

Neo-Kobe City originated at the end of the 20th century from the man-made islands in the Seto Inland Sea, such as Port Island, Rokko Island, High Harborland, Kobe International Airport (Kobe Airport), and Kobe Industrial Complex, which were divided into five blocks. The expansion of the city gave birth to the great man-made continent we know today as Neo-Kouvet City.
Neo-Kouvet City is a high-tech information city of the 21st century with intelligent buildings equipped with information and communication systems, artificial land and waterfront, and complete with environmental facilities such as underground motorways, underground energy lines, waste disposal pipelines, fiber optics, artificial rivers, district cooling and vacuum systems from the beginning.
Neo-Cove City was created as an international city, approved for occupancy by various racial and ethnic groups, and was a cosmopolis intended for cultural and technological exchange, which resulted in the creation of a racial crucible at sea. Today, it is the first and second largest crime city in the world (Climbville), which has become a haven for various criminals and mutants.

Old Port Island

Former Port Island, which had been sinking by 3cm per year since the beginning of 1980, was completely submerged by the Gobo Offshore Earthquake in 1994.
In 1995, Kouvet City had a plan to use the metal resources of the former Port Island as part of a new artificial island project, but the plan was abandoned due to cost concerns. Today, a vast amount of metal resources still lie on the old Port Island.

artificial island construction method

As the ground is fragile and there are many dormant volcanoes in Japan, the risk of submersion is unavoidable in the case of reclaimed earth and sand. In the new island construction method, a steel frame with a maximum width of 1.25mm is coated with a hard resin coating of 5mm to prevent corrosion for the base. The steel frame (super frame) is buried up to 90m below the ground and the foundation is 2.5m above standard sea level to provide a solid ground and allow for water penetration by high waves and other events.
The ground is 2.5m above the standard sea level, and it is designed to accommodate solid ground and high waves, etc. However, even with this method, Neo-Koube City has been sinking at an average rate of 8mm per year for 10 years between 2032 and 2042.

About 4.82 million superframes have been used in the construction of Neo-Koube City, including the new Kobe Airport.

Neo-Cove's energy form

Åú
Conventional energy forms

Liquefied natural gas (LNG)

LNG storage terminal plants are clustered in the southern end of the Neo-Cove region.

Nuclear power

In 1992, the first nuclear power plant in Kobe, "Kuroshio", started up. Since then, we have had no accidents.

Nuclear Fusion

In 2030, the Kansai region's first fusion reactor, Prometheus, will start up. The proportion of electricity supplied has been increasing every year.

Oil

Half of the oil storage terminal plant has been abandoned since the turn of the century. Various events have been held in the City using this abandoned plant.

Åú
Use of Renewable Energy

solar power generation

Various on-orbit, solar-powered population satellites will send the converted solar energy to us 24 hours a day, aggregating it from various on-orbit, solar-powered satellites.

Wave power generation

A wave power plant has been installed on the embankment surrounding the south side of Neo-Cove to achieve high energy recovery efficiency.

Thermoelectric power generation

A total of three thermoelectric plants have been activated on the coast of Neo-Kouvet. They make use of the temperature difference between the surface seawater and the surface of Koobe.

Hydroelectric power generation

Today, 80% of hydroelectricity is generated by the Ina River, a man-made river.


Neo-Cove Energy Supply in 2042

LNG
13%.

hydraulic power
10%.

nuclear power
30%.

oil
30%.

Other
17%.

(2042 study)


A seawater uranium recovery system is one of the power generation facilities that is currently attracting attention. The seawater uranium recovery system is a concept of Tenjo Corporation and Kobe Electric Power Company, and the offshore plant is currently under construction.
The seawater uranium recovery system plant will perform uranium adsorption, enrichment, solvent, extraction, precipitation, filtration, and processing of uranium dissolved in seawater in an integrated manner for nuclear power generation.
It is expected to achieve an energy supply rate of 20% by 2053.

BATTLE-TECHNIQUE
-Battle Techniques.

Basic Battle Techniques

The player can attack enemies part by part when attacking with a gun. (It attacks a target set point.) There are various types of enemies, such as strong attackers, thickly armored and fast ones. Depending on the enemy type, you have to think of a strategy to attack.
When the enemy's LIFE is 0, the enemy is destroyed.

Åú
antenna
Åú

Send out a radio wave from here to collect your fellow Metal Creatures.
When you attack, you can battle without creating more enemies.

Åú
weapons
Åú

Enemies with high attack power will have their attack power reduced when they attack the muzzle.
However, be aware that some enemies will self-destruct and damage the player with the blast if the weapon becomes completely unusable.

Åú
IMODUL
Åú

Attacking here lowers your ability to see the player, misses your aim and prevents you from attacking accurately.

Åú
buddy
Åú

Important mechanisms are gathered together and LIFE is lowered.

Åú
Drive Unit
Åú

When you attack, you can slow down an enemy.
Speedy enemies will run away if you attack them, so aim at their legs first.

35

---Page 36
Application I
<To gather friends and defeat fast enemies

1.
Aim at the enemy's key points and they'll dodge, so first, shoot them in the foot to stop them from moving.

Ugh.

2.
Break a leg, and we're on our own. Break the antennae before you get your people together.

Geez.

3.
In this case, it's just a big fat boy. Let's take our time and aim at the body of the thing.

Oh, my God!

36

---Page 37
Application II
<<To take down an enemy with good offensive power and accurate aim>>

1.
First, aim at the tricky Aymodule.
This will make it harder for the enemy's attacks to hit you.

Heehee.

2.
Just in case you want to attack the enemy's weapons too, it's perfect!
The enemy can't do anything about it anymore.

Eh.

3.
The only thing left to do is to destroy it by tormenting it slowly.

Erm.........
